# Cerverus

A high performance webserver made for linux first, should eventually also be able to be used for other types of servers such as game servers. Should also include an test-suite for testing servers. The server will be based around htmx, with it's own templating engine.

## TODO

- Outlined tests
  - Up Next: finish a format for 
- Add an table that tracks performance over time for the project
- Dynamic routes
- Trie for routing
- Other file formats (mp4/mp3/etc.)
- Uploading/Downloading Files
- io_uring

## Prerequisites

- make
- clang
- Platform (Linux only, so far)

## Features

A prerelease version is working!

- Can host a static website
- Only allows for GET requests

### Upcoming

- platform wrapper
- filesystem
- updated filesystem and request handling with io_uring on linux to up performance

## Benchmark

For a report to be created all unit tests must have passed as well as the smoke test. Specifc stats are for a peak load test with the arguments seen in the report. Note that key changes since the last report are included.

### Report 22/02/2026

Stats:

Call:
```benchmark();```

## Structure

Create a server, set it up, run it (more in depth documentation coming, for now just check out the default/example project).

### Server

The server parses requests into structures and passes them on to the router you passed it. This is also where you define stuff like protocols, ports, etc.

### Request

An request is an internal structure representing an request, that can be parsed.

### Response

An response is an internal structure representing an response, that can be serialized.
